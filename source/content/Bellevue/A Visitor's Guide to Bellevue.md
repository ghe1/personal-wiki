## 🔗Before You Get Here...

Before you get here, highly recommend some important and helpful tips that will make your trip to Bellevue just a little bit easier!
- [**Ride Circuit / Bellhop**](https://www.visitbellevuewa.com/bellhop/) -- Local last-mile transit that is FREE. But also, a little slow during peak hours. Use it to get around the city if it's raining or if you're tired.
- [**Bellevue Airport Shuttle**](https://www.visitbellevuewa.com/listing/bellevue-airport-shuttle/2753/)  -- A $30 pp one-way shuttle from SEA to downtown Bellevue hotels (limited hotels, but easily walkable to everywhere). 
- [**ORCA Card**](https://www.myorca.com/) -- The ORCA card is the single transit card that you can use to get around nearly all Seattle based transit systems.

> [!warning] 
> Uber and Lyft at SEA are EXTREMELY SLOW and EXPENSIVE. Do not recommend calling an Uber unless you're willing to wait up to an hour, or if you call it right when you get to the gate.
