# 🚗 Getting Around Bellevue

Bellevue is easy to navigate whether you're walking, driving, or using public transit. Here's everything you need to know to get from A to B with minimal stress.

## 🚶 On Foot

- **Downtown Bellevue** is very walkable — hotels, restaurants, parks, and shops are all within a few blocks.
- Crosswalks are clearly marked and well-timed, though it’s smart to bring a rain jacket or umbrella for unexpected drizzles.

## 🚗 By Car

- Driving is often the easiest way to explore the surrounding areas (Seattle, Snoqualmie Falls, Woodinville, etc.).
- Traffic is light on weekends but can be busy during weekday rush hours (7–9 AM and 4–6 PM).
- GPS apps like **Google Maps** or **Waze** are your best friends — they account for real-time traffic.

### 🅿️ Parking Tips

- Most **downtown hotels** offer parking (sometimes for a fee).
- **Bellevue Square & Lincoln Square** offer **free covered parking** — even if you’re not shopping there.
- Street parking is metered but usually plentiful outside of peak hours.
- Many parks and public areas also have free or low-cost lots.

## 🚌 Public Transit

- **King County Metro** buses serve Bellevue well, including direct routes to Seattle and Redmond.
- Use the **Transit GO** app or **Google Maps** to check schedules and pay for rides.
- Fares are typically around $2.75 and buses are clean, safe, and reliable.
- **RapidRide B Line** is great for getting across the Eastside quickly.

## 🚈 Light Rail (Coming Soon)

- The **East Link Light Rail** is under construction and set to open in **late 2025** — when ready, it’ll connect Bellevue directly to Seattle and SeaTac Airport.

## 🚖 Rideshares & Taxis

- **Uber and Lyft** are widely available and often faster than public transit, especially for short hops.
- Airport rides typically cost around $40–60 depending on time of day.

## 🚲 Bikes & Scooters

- Bellevue has some bike lanes and a few scenic trails (like around Downtown Park or Mercer Slough).
- **Bike rentals** and **scooter shares** come and go, so check apps like **Lime** or **Bird** to see what’s available.

## ✈️ From the Airport (SEA)

- **Driving from SeaTac to Bellevue** takes ~25–35 minutes.
- Uber/Lyft are convenient but can be extremely slow, despite what the app may lead you to believe.
- [**Bellevue Airport Shuttle**](https://www.visitbellevuewa.com/listing/bellevue-airport-shuttle/2753/)  -- A $30 pp one-way shuttle from SEA to downtown Bellevue hotels (limited hotels, but easily walkable to everywhere). \
- Light Rail to Seattle + a transfer will work once East Link opens (but not right now)
